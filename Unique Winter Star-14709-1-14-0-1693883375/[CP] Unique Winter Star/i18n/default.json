	//Hello, i18n readers! If you're here, you're where the dialogues happen. Either you're a translator (hi, translators! You can delete this!) or you're a user wanting to change a dialogue yourself (or just read the dialogues). The i18n is organized into sections.
	//In general, organization is Festival (Winter Star or Solstice), then Regular/Datables/Dating/DatingPPAF/Marriage/MarriagePPAF. The earlier dialogues are the person *gifting* you, while the GIFTING DIALOGUES section is for you gifting to an NPC.
	//Please also note that {{termOfEndearment}} is PPAF's user-defined endearment term, so please leave that as is if translating.
