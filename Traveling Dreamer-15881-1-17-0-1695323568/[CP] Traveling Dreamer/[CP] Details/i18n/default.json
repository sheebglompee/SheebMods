"sun.Phoebe.winter.1": "I noticed there's not really a place of worship here.#$b#I’m not religious myself, but usually there’s some type of place to pray to some type of god in town.#$b#Sort of an interesting difference compared to other places.$4",
"sun.Phoebe.winter.2": "Sorry  bud, my energy is totally unavailable today.$2#$b#I am just too tired to socialize…$3#$e#%She lifts a brow and then starts ignoring you.",

"shore.Phoebe.2": "I love a nice day at the beach, but I really am getting fed up with getting sand all up in my orifices.$3#$b#What? Is that TMI? It’s the truth!",

"umbrella.Phoebe.1": "I should bring Barron here, she really loves swimming at the Inn, so maybe the ocean will be even better.$1",
"umbrella.Phoebe.2": "I should have brought some lotion, my skin is feeling dry and uncomfortable right now.$3#$b#But hey, the beach is sort of worth it!$1",

"wander.Phoebe.1": "I could have sworn I heard this bird talking to me.$3#$b#Maybe I need to cool down a bit before my brain fries.$4",
"wander.Phoebe.2": "Today's music just doesn't hit the same as the music from my childhood.$2#$b#Guess I just like the older rock and roll songs.$1",

"bar.Phoebe.1": "%Her cheeks are dark red, she’s been drinking a while.",
"bar.Phoebe.2": "%Her mouth is full, Phoebe can’t talk right now.",

"Bookcase.ArkaniaObjects.03": "Horses or Bulls are commonly used to pull wagons, while some residents take to the seas in boats. Sailing and fishing are very common; in fact, fishing is the main source of income for the island.",
"Bookcase.ArkaniaObjects.04": "They do this via Shrines that can be found throughout the island in seemingly inconspicuous locations. Among other important symbols are the warrior and lucky hare totems of Arlo. These totems are said to not only protect what's left of the island, but also said to guard the child goddess Arlo.",
"Bookcase.ArkaniaObjects.05": " Transportation has remained primative and non-industrialized as well; this is because the residents of Tuuwe believe in the power and importance of nature.",

"Bookcase.LovedAggie.Cover": "Aggie The Love",
"Bookcase.LovedAggie.01": "Once upon a time, there was a woman that towered above even the tallest of warriors. Her hands were rough like leather, and her limbs as thick as the trunk of a tree. She was strong and sturdy like the very forest of Arkánia. But she was also just as lonely as she was powerful. But then from over the waters came someone new. He stood smaller than most and equally as thin. His skin was dark and aged but youth shined in his brown eyes.",
"Bookcase.LovedAggie.02": "With a graceful stride, he passed her by, somehow oblivious to her presence. The woman was enthralled by him and as he walked away, her dark gaze stayed locked to his back.Immediately, she wanted this man to notice her, but as months went by, he never quite did.",
"Bookcase.LovedAggie.03": " She was determined to change that fact, and one night at the village watering hole, she made an approach. Distracted by his friends and groggy from wine, the stranger didn’t see her at first. But once she scooped him up into her arms, he had no choice but to notice her.",
"Bookcase.LovedAggie.04": " The woman walked away from his friends with him clinging to her neck, having been frightened by the prospect of being dropped. Back at her favorite spot, the woman carefully placed the man down. ",
"Bookcase.LovedAggie.05": "She grinned wide and goofy before patting his shoulder. 'Talk to me now?' she asked with a hum, and the stranger found himself smiling right back. His cheeks grew warm and his gaze brightened. No one had ever demanded his attention quite like the way she had.",
"Bookcase.LovedAggie.06": "As off-putting as it was, he was smitten with her assertiveness. It was after that night that the woman was no longer alone. And the stranger, who was just as different as she was, found a love he had not been expecting.",

"Bookcase.LillyPirates.Cover": "The Death Lily Pirates",
"Bookcase.LillyPirates.01": "The Death Lily Pirates are an infamous group known across the Gem Sea. However, despite their reputation, not much is known about the crew. The spider lily motif on their Jolly Roger sparks fear, but almost every person who has crossed paths with the group has lived to tell the tale.",
"Bookcase.LillyPirates.02": "Many a merchant ship has fallen victim to the Death Lily Pirates. The victims tell of supernatural beings ranging from magic-wielding humans to grotesque goblins heard of only in books. Some have even claimed to see elves and mermaids amongst the attackers.",
"Bookcase.LillyPirates.03": "Even still, the biggest mystery of the crew isn't their non-violence or the origin of its members; it lies with the captain. Among all the stories told about the pirates, very few ever make mention of their leader. Even fewer mention her by name.",
"Bookcase.LillyPirates.04": "Calypso the Siren Song. She is theorized to be the daughter of the previous captain, Claudia the Endsinger.",
"Bookcase.LillyPirates.05": "The only known fact about Claudia is at the peak of her career she disappeared, and Calypso took her place.",

"Bookcase.Lyell.02": "We have agreed to name her Lyza, and while my little girl looks different, I still love her more than anything in this world. Constantina is frightened of Lyza, though. I am confused why she can't look past our little girl’s malformation.",
"Bookcase.Lyell.03": "Her upper lip may be split, but she's still our child. I hope my dear wife can let go of her fear...She still hasn't held Lyza. I've been feeding her goat's milk in place of her mother's. -LH",
"Bookcase.Lyell.04": "Journal, it's been years since I wrote. In fact, since our daughter Lyza was born. Constantina has grown to love our little girl. Her cleft lip no longer scares her, and for that, I am grateful.",
"Bookcase.Lyell.05": "However, Constantina is unbearably protective and her disdain towards the residents of the neighboring island truly disturbs me. She calls them evil because they worship Arah instead of Liphum.",
"Bookcase.Lyell.06":"I'm worried... She doesn't know that I worship both deities. I fear she'll leave if she ever finds out. Therefore, I'm keeping it secret. I can't let her know. -LH",
