We held a panel discussion about genre and writing, and afterwards the four of us went to a local dive and spent nearly half the night talking about writing and the industry. It makes me realize that we are all in this together; as Willy would say, a rising tide lifts all boats.^^Even with the new friends I've made, I still long for the quiet of Pelican Town and the beauty of the farm. On these long travels between towns, I amuse myself by closing my eyes and envisioning the farm... I see kegs pulsing with sweet wine, a furnace ablaze with precious ore, and our little kitchen with the smell of cinnamon and nutmeg. There's a lot to enjoy!^^Just don't stay out too late in the mines, {{TermofEndearment}}. It's dangerous in there! If you must go... bring plenty of food.^^-Love, Elliott %item conversationTopic ElliottGone6 0 %%[#]Letter From Elliott 5",

It's been heartwarming to meet people who enjoy my work, and to make new friends of my peers (whom I shall keep in touch with with the wonders of the internet--finally, a reason not to fear it so much.) Yet I am eager to return home.^^I look forward to the comfort of our little house, the satisfying farm work, a home-cooked meal, and most of all, cozying up by the fire with you.^^See you soon!^-Love, Elliott %item conversationTopic ElliottGone7 0 %%[#]Letter From Elliott 6",
