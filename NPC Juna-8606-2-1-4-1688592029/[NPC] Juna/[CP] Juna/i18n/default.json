  "winter.25.2": "Of course I don't always give my secret friend something they hate.$2#$b#Firstly, it's predictable, and secondly, most of the people in this town seem to hate things I'd rather keep for myself. Why would I ever give AWAY a dinosaur egg?$10",

  //VANILLA NPC DIALOGUE

  "robin.spring.mondays": "Sometimes, well, often really, Juna goes off on these long tangents about flowers, plants and nature.#$b#She complains a lot about her upbringing and her Junimo family, but they've clearly had an effect on her.#$b#One time I said I liked lilies, and she made this sound as if she was going to vomit.

  "wizard.sunday.2.3": "%The Wizard's eye is twitching uncontrollably.",
  "wizard.sunday.4.5": "Much of what comes out of Juna's mouth makes more sense, I suspect, inside her head than outside it. Sometimes I follow her logic, sometimes I don't.#$b#Today I definitely don't.",
  "wizard.sunday.6.7.before": "You planted that book, Juna! I saw you!",
  "wizard.sunday.8.9.wizard": "Oh, I don't know if heartbreaking is the right word exactly. Considering you did put approximately 30 dirty socks in my bed while you were here.#$b#She doesn't even wear socks ...",
  "wizard.sunday.8.9.parents": "Ah, yes. I wept bitter tears the entire time, I assure you.#$b#In fact, if you see any suspicious stains on my notes, it's definitely from those tears - not because I was so badly startled watching a horror movie that I accidentally spilled tea all over myself.",
  "wizard.sunday.10.wizardspring": "Of course Juna only ever looks back fondly on the past when the past involves me making a fool of myself.",
  "wizard.sunday.10.wizardsummer": "Juna and I have an agreement. I watch her dance on Fridays and she listens when I try to teach her more about potions.#$b#Today's potion included lemon juice, and, well... here we are.",

  "wizard.sunday.10.wizardwinter": "So... well. There comes a time... uhm, well, yes. I think. The thing is- people! With other people. Sometimes. You know? Like my ex-wife! She's people. Is that... *cough*... Yes? Something for you, perhaps?",
  "wizard.sunday.10.parentspring": "I do indeed have siblings. And since you asked so nicely, I'm going to tell you all about them, Ju.",
  "wizard.sunday.10.parentsummer": "I made the grave mistake of telling Juna about seeing my ex-wife for the first time in, oh, years? Now every time I open my mouth, she starts singing that blasted song.",
  "wizard.sunday.10.parentfall": "Must you talk about your hobby in here of all places, Ju? I'm trying to get some work done.",
  "wizard.sunday.10.parentwinter": "I keep telling you, Ju, financial irresponsibility is no laughing matter. You should feel bad for your parents.",
  "wizard.roommate.2.6": "I could have sworn I'd hidden money in this book. Hm.",
  "wizard.roommate.3.19": "... and then a little bit of this, or... hm, maybe not...#$b#I don't have time for you right now. Juna being here has had a severe impact on my productivity. I need to finish this before she's finished dancing.",

  "wizard.conversation.big_foot": "... What do you mean, you saw me in the forest?#$b#That wasn't me, that was someone else. Plenty of wizards like the color purple, I assure you. Now go away, I have important work to do.",
  "robin.conversation.cave": "So you've been to Juna's home, have you?#$b#A potato? Last time I was there, she gave me three cherries and half a slice of cake.$1#$b#Don't worry, I'm sure you'll reach cake status soon enough.",
  "robin.conversation.wizard": "Have you seen Juna this week? She sent me a weird message saying she had to cancel all our meet-ups this week.#$b#She's spending the entire week with the Wizard? Yikes. I better get the alcohol ready for next week, then.#$b#I hope she's doing all right...$2",
  "robin.conversation.gone": "Crazy to think Juna's gone to find her parents, right?#$b#I hope they don't hurt her more than they already have.$2#$b#If they do, can I count on you to help me get revenge?$3",
  "robin.conversation.robin": "Listen to this: according to legend, a woman named Mother Leeds had given birth a dozen times, and on her 13th pregnancy she muttered: \"Let this one be the devil!\". And that's how the Jersey Devil was born.#$b#Doesn't that sound like something Juna would relate to?$6#$b#Oh, of course we don't actually believe cryptids exist! This is just a game we play sometimes when we're bored with playing poker.$4",
  "robin.conversation.picnic": "That was some picnic the other day, wasn't it?$1#$b#I'm still not 100 percent sure about Rasmodius, but despite evidence to the contrary, Juna is a grown woman and deserves to make her own decisions.",
  "willy.conversation": "Ay, I've seen the girly in black dance. She's not at the beach every time it rains, but it's always raining when she's there.#$b#I've seen her around town, 'course, but she doesn' strike me as someone who likes the waves.#$b#She always looks so sad...$2",
  "jas.conversation": "Sometimes the lady with the pale hair watches me jump rope, which is kinda weird.#$b#But sometimes I watch the lady with the pale hair dance in the forest, so I guess that's ok!$1#$b#That's called E-Q-U-A-L-I-T-Y.$4",
  "abigail.conversation": "I know this is going to sound weird, but... did you see me with Juna by the forest lake a couple of nights ago? Because if you didn't I must have had the strangest dream!$9",
  "leo.conversation": "Juna's told me a lot about the Junimos. They remind me of my parrot family. I hope she finds what she's looking for.",

  "juna.JulietGremlin": "There I was, wondering if today would be the day I'd finally be reunited with my long lost twin Juliet, when suddenly I noticed she'd gained a cute new companion.$10#$b#And who am I to stand in the way of interspecies familial bonding? Olive would never forgive me.$1",
  "juna.LavrilUnlocked": "I'm thinking Olive, I'm thinking Void, I'm thinking the world's best playdate. Yes? Yes!$1",
  "juna.LucikielArrives": "In my experience, demons are rather single-minded.#$b#The obsession with sweet things is tolerable, but there's only so much possessive romance one can take before the abs stop being worth it.$11",
  "juna.ReputationIncreased": "Yes, but is Lucikiel still smouldering left and right? Because then I'm still not impressed.$11",
  "juna.JasperGone2": "Olive was wondering if you knew where that scruffy academic had disappeared to?$8#$b#I told him to stop worrying, but he has a tendency to turn clingy when he meets people who drops lines like \"mystery of the earth\" and \"the slumbering presence in the forest\".$9",

  "juna.event_postweddingreception": "Yes, yes, congrats on the wedding and the love. Did your wedding reception include sitting on the floor pretending to be rocking a boat like a bunch of absolute maniacs?#$b#No? Boo, boring. Then I'm not interested.$2",
  "juna.PTJ03": "I make it my mission to support any and all pranks taking place in Pelican Town.$1#$b#Also, those two look kind of cute together.$10#$b#The only reason I let you hear me say that is because it involves Juliet, my long lost twin, and if you were to tell someone I did I'll say something to Pierre that'll make him blush everytime he sees you.$5#$b#Trust me, having Pierre blush at you is just as traumatizing as you think it is.$5",

  "juna.SterlingBike": "Sure, bikes are fine and all, but if you really want to get up close and personal with someone, you should try teleportation.$3#$b#No, you are NOT allowed to tell Sterling. If he learns any more flirty tricks, I'll be the one puking into a trashcan.$5",
  "juna.SterlingDrugs": "Me thinks Sterling doth protest too much about women trying to fix him.$11#$b#Besides, all I asked were for him to take his party over to Raz's tower instead. Partly because it would annoy Raz, sure, but also because Wellwick is an absolute delight, and I knew she was there at the time. Everyone wins!#$b#Well, everyone except for Raz and future Sterling, I suppose.$11",
  "juna.SterlingTrashAlex": "I briefly considered making Sterling my honorary little brother, but I eventually settled on Alex instead. I think it's because Sterling reminds me too much of Olive's aunt.#$b#It's that jittery look in their eyes, you know? Well, that and the puking.$11#$b#Now, Mia, though. Have you met her yet? I know you know I despise flirting, but for her I just might make an exception.$3",
