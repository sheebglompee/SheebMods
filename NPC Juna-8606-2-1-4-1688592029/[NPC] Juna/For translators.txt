FOR TRANSLATORS

2.1.4
Added new dialogue when inviting roommate Juna to the movies, marked with NEW in the default.json

GENERAL TRANSLATION INSTRUCTIONS

There are four things that need to be translated in Juna:

- The default.json in the i18n folder
	Contains the majority of Juna's content. When you're done, simple rename your file using the appropriate language code (example: es.json for Spanish).

- The DialogueForTranslation.json in the Translation folder
	Contains Juna's daily dialogue. When you've translated this, I recommend sending it to me so I can help you put it back in its proper place. As you can see in the Dialogue folder, Juna's daily dialogue is split between 3 different files, and it can be confusing putting it back yourself. Simply translating this document and leaving it as is won't work.

- Juna's ring, i.e. the object.json in the [CC] Juna Companion Ring/Objects/JunaRing folder.
	- Add your translation of the name and description next to your language code under "NameLocalization" and "DescriptionLocalization" and remove the two // in front of the code.
	- Replace the English text after "CategoryTextOverride" with your translation.

- Juna's painting, i.e. the object.json in the [JA] Juna Roommate Item/Objects/Painting of Juna folder
	- Add your translation of the name and description next to your language code under "NameLocalization" and "DescriptionLocalization" and remove the two // in front of the code.
	- Replace the English text after "CategoryTextOverride" with your translation.

When you're ready to upload your translation mod, the folder structure should look like this in order for your translation to overwrite the English text properly:

[NPC] Juna

|-[CC] Juna Companion Ring

|		|-JunaRing
|			|-object.json
|
|-[CP] Juna
