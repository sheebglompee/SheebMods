FOR DATE CREATORS:

There are two template files in this folder - GenericOverrideExample.json and UniqueDates.json. Before releasing, make sure to rename your files to the Spouse's name that you are writing for!

These folders are meant to be placed in the data/Custom/GenericOverride and data/Custom/Unique folders respectively.

This is not an event coding tutorial. Please check StardewValleyWiki for help on writing events: https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Event_data

FOR ALL EVENTS: If you do not want to write multiple events for suggestive/non-suggesitve, just remove the "SuggestiveEndings" field in the "When" section of the date.

********** GENERIC OVERRIDES: **********

The template provided is for overriding the Saloon Date. Everything can be changed except for the event ids and mail ids, which are required for Event Repeater to work.

There are 6 Generic Dates you can override. The IDs are shown below:

	1116009, //Saloon Initiation
	1116010, //Saloon Date

	1116011, //Picnic Initiation
	1116012, //Picnic Date

	1116013, //Library Initiation
	1116014, //Library Date

	1116019, //Dance Date (Only Occurs 1st Of Every Month)

	1116020, //Beach Initiation
	1116021, //Beach Date
	1116022, //Swimming Bug Fix

	1116023, //Grocery Initiation
	1116024, //Grocery Date

	1116025, //Camping Initation
	1116026, //Camping Date

These are the mail flags set when the player accepts a date.

	"saloonDateAgree",
	"forestDateAgree",
	"libraryDateAgree",
	"beachDateAgree",
	"swimmingDateFix", //used only if the player will end up swimming at the end of an event. Signals the use of event 1116022 (Swimming Bug Fix)
	"groceryDateAgree",
	"campingDateAgree",

Please look at data/generic for the dates that are already made if you'd like to just alter dialogue or look at how each date is formatted.

If you want to add another override, simply copy the Saloon Template and paste it again below the event you have already made. Then, change the event ID to match one above, and change the mail flag set when the player agrees to the corresponding flag.

NOTE: The dance date does not have a "date" event - you could say the initiation event is the actual date.

Finally, change the "When" condition on the initiation event to the generic event you'd like to override next. Valid values are:

saloon, forest, library, dance, beach, grocery, camping

********* UNIQUE DATES: **********

Each Custom NPC can have up to 20 unique dates. The event ids used for the 20 dates are:

	1117001, //Unique 1 Initiation
	1117101, //Unique 1 Date
	1117002, //Unique 2 Initiation
	1117102, //Unique 2 Date
	1117003, //Unique 3 Initiation
	1117103, //Unique 3 Date
	1117004, //Unique 4 Initiation
	1117104, //Unique 4 Date
	1117005, //Unique 5 Initiation
	1117105, //Unique 5 Date
	1117006, //Unique 6 Initiation
	1117106, //Unique 6 Date
	1117007, //Unique 7 Initiation
	1117107, //Unique 7 Date
	1117008, //Unique 8 Initiation
	1117108, //Unique 8 Date
	1117009, //Unique 9 Initiation
	1117109, //Unique 9 Date
	1117010, //Unique 10 Initiation
	1117110, //Unique 10 Date
	1117011, //Unique 11 Initiation
	1117111, //Unique 11 Date

	1117113, //Unique 13 Date
	1117014, //Unique 14 Initiation
	1117114, //Unique 14 Date
	1117015, //Unique 15 Initiation
	1117115, //Unique 15 Date
	1117016, //Unique 16 Initiation
	1117116, //Unique 16 Date
	1117017, //Unique 17 Initiation
	1117117, //Unique 17 Date
	1117018, //Unique 18 Initiation
	1117118, //Unique 18 Date
	1117019, //Unique 19 Initiation
	1117119, //Unique 19 Date
	1117020, //Unique 20 Initiation
	1117120, //Unique 20 Date

The mail flags set when accepting are:

	"unique1Agree",
	"unique2Agree",
	"unique3Agree",
	"unique4Agree",
	"unique5Agree",
	"unique6Agree",
	"unique7Agree",
	"unique8Agree",
	"unique9Agree",
	"unique10Agree",
	"unique11Agree",
	"unique12Agree",
	"unique13Agree",
	"unique14Agree",
	"unique15Agree",
	"unique16Agree",
	"unique17Agree",
	"unique18Agree",
	"unique19Agree",
	"unique20Agree",

Everything about the date can be changed. If there are certain conditions to when the date can/cannot be done then add them as event conditions for initiation. 

If you want to add another override, simply copy the Unique 1 Template and paste it again below the event you have already made. Then, change the event ID to match one above, and change the mail flag set when the player agrees to the corresponding flag.

Finally, change the "UniqueDateType" field in the "When" field. It takes one of the following:

unique1,unique2,unique3,unique4,unique5,unique6,unique7,unique8,unique9,unique10,unique11,unique12,unique13,unique14,unique15,unique16,unique17,unique18,unique19,unique20

*IF you have not assigned all 20 dates you may notice that you aren't getting your date as often as you like - this is because the game rolls an empty date. You can change the UniqueDateType field to include multiple flags to increase the chance of getting the date among the unique dates - if you only have one it is advised to have the field contain all like so:

"UniqueDateType": "unique1,unique2,unique3,unique4,unique5,unique6,unique7,unique8,unique9,unique10,unique11,unique12,unique13,unique14,unique15,unique16,unique17,unique18,unique19,unique20"

*NOTE: If you are adding unique dates for vanilla spouses Emily, Alex, Maru, or Haley (who already have events), then your file will overrite their events as well. If you'd like to keep them, then you can copy them from the original file and reassign the dates to a "unique" id. (Including changing the "When" file).
