Please come visit me at the Adventurer's Guild, I have some information I'd like to share with you that would be better discussed in person.^^-Marlon",
        "purrplingcat.npcadventure.adventureContinue": "Hello @,^^I was pleased to hear of your recent escapades with some of the young people I spoke with you about at the guild. It does my heart good to see you all take an interest in exploring this land and being supportive to one another. Community is important, especially for a town of this size.^^I hope you and your companions will help keep the adventurer's spirit alive long after I'm gone. Come by the guild anytime, I'll always be glad to see you, and maybe you'll have a new story or two to tell.^^-Marlon",
